# Charmonia Plot

## Overview

The Charmonia Plot project, developed by the Joint Physics Analysis Center, is dedicated to the visualization and analysis of exotic spectrum in hadron physics.
This repository contains code and resources for generating plots of exotic states with their masses and quantum numbers.
Our goal is to provide an accessible and good looking review plot for physicists and researchers.

The plotting script produces
- [`exotics_review.png`](https://jointphysicsanalysiscenter.github.io/Charmonia-Plot/exotics_review.png): Current state of heavy-quark hadron resonances with charm with the $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states,
- [`exotics_mesons.png`](https://jointphysicsanalysiscenter.github.io/Charmonia-Plot/exotics_meson.png): Current state of heavy-quark hadron resonances with charm w/o the $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states, 
- [`charmonia_pre2003.png`](https://jointphysicsanalysiscenter.github.io/Charmonia-Plot/charmonia_pre2003.png): Charmonium spectrum before X(3872)

## Installation

To get started with the Charmonia Plot project, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JointPhysicsAnalysisCenter/Charmonia-Plot.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required Python packages:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

After installation, you can generate the plots by running the main script:

```bash
python Exotics_plot.py
```
