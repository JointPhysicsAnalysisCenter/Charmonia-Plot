# Charmonia-Plot
Plot of chamonia and exotics

This is a simple python code that plots:

1 - Current state of heavy-quark hadron resonances with charm with the Pc
2 - Current state of heavy-quark hadron resonances with charm w/o the Pc
3 - Charmonium spectrum before X(3872)

The code is very raw right now. Hope to improve it in the future to make it easy to update.
